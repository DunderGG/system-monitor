# Design Decisions

Rationale for non-obvious implementation choices made during development.

## Phase 1 — Domain types (`src/domain/`)

### CMake library type: `INTERFACE` (header-only)

**Decision:** `sysmon_domain` is declared as a CMake `INTERFACE` library with no compiled sources.

**Rationale:** Every domain type is a plain aggregate struct or `enum class`. There are no method bodies, no `.cpp` translation units, and nothing to link. An `INTERFACE` target is the idiomatic CMake choice in this situation: it propagates the `src/` include path transitively to any downstream target via `target_link_libraries`, so consumers never need to repeat `target_include_directories`. A `STATIC` library would produce an empty archive and add a link step with zero benefit.

### `ProcessInfo::creationTime` type: `std::chrono::system_clock::time_point`

**Decision:** The process creation timestamp is stored as `std::chrono::system_clock::time_point`, not `uint64_t` raw FILETIME or `steady_clock::time_point`.

**Rationale:** The source value is a Windows `FILETIME` — a 100-nanosecond tick count since 1601-01-01, which is a calendar epoch. `system_clock` is the C++ clock that maps to calendar time, making the conversion at the platform boundary lossless and semantically correct. `steady_clock` is reserved for `SystemSnapshot::timestamp` where monotonic elapsed-time arithmetic is needed (CPU %, network throughput rates). Storing a raw `uint64_t` would leak a Windows type into the domain layer, which must remain platform-free.

---

### `SystemSnapshot::timestamp` type: `std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point`

**Decision:** `SystemSnapshot::timestamp` uses `steady_clock`, not `system_clock`.

**Rationale:** The timestamp exists solely for rate calculations (CPU usage %, network bytes/sec) between consecutive snapshots. `steady_clock` is monotonic and unaffected by system clock adjustments or DST transitions, making delta calculations reliable. It carries no calendar meaning; the UI must use `system_clock::now()` separately if it needs a human-readable time to display.

---

### `NetworkSample` stores cumulative byte counters, not rates

**Decision:** `inBytesTotal` and `outBytesTotal` are cumulative totals as returned by `GetIfTable2`, not pre-computed bytes/sec rates.

**Rationale:** Rate computation requires dividing a byte delta by a precisely measured time delta. That measurement belongs in the collector, which owns the `steady_clock` baseline from the previous tick. Storing a rate in the domain type would mean the type carries a value that depends on when it was last queried — breaking the immutable-snapshot guarantee. Cumulative counters are also correct across tick-interval jitter, whereas a rate pre-computed with an assumed interval would drift if the scheduler tick is late.

---

### `OperationalStatus` enum: all 7 `IF_OPER_STATUS` values

**Decision:** `OperationalStatus` includes all seven values from the Windows `IF_OPER_STATUS` enum (`Up`, `Down`, `Testing`, `Unknown`, `Dormant`, `NotPresent`, `LowerLayerDown`), not a trimmed subset.

**Rationale:** A 1:1 mapping between the domain enum and the Windows API enum makes the platform-boundary conversion trivial and keeps the domain type self-documenting. Collapsing values (e.g. merging `Dormant` and `NotPresent` into a generic `Inactive`) would lose information that the UI or future alert logic might need. The domain module has no Windows dependency — having the same *shape* as a Windows enum does not violate the no-Windows-headers rule.

---

### `std::optional` for `ProcessInfo::imagePath` and `::commandLine`

**Decision:** Image path and command line are `std::optional<std::string>`, not empty strings.

**Rationale:** These fields are acquired lazily — only on the first detection of a new `(pid, creationTime)` pair — and may be permanently unavailable for protected or system processes even with `PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION`. An empty string is ambiguous: it could mean "not yet queried", "query failed", or "the process genuinely has no path". `std::nullopt` is unambiguous: this data is not available. The UI can branch on `has_value()` to render a clear indicator rather than displaying a blank field.

---

### `ProcessInfo::accessDenied` flag kept in-band

**Decision:** `ProcessInfo` includes an `accessDenied` bool rather than being omitted from the snapshot or replaced with an error variant at the `vector<ProcessInfo>` level.

**Rationale:** Even when a process cannot be fully introspected, `NtQuerySystemInformation` returns its name and PID. Omitting the process from the snapshot entirely would silently hide it from the user (wrong: Task Manager shows all processes). A separate error list alongside `vector<ProcessInfo>` would force all UI code to merge two collections. The in-band flag keeps the snapshot a single coherent list and lets the UI render a partial row — image name visible, metrics showing `—` — which is the same pattern used by Task Manager and Process Explorer.

---

### CPU times stored as cumulative milliseconds, not percentages

**Decision:** `ProcessInfo::cpuUserTimeMs` and `::cpuKernelTimeMs` are cumulative totals in milliseconds, not pre-computed CPU percentages.

**Rationale:** CPU percentage for a process requires comparing the CPU time delta between two snapshots against the wall-clock delta between those same snapshots. This calculation belongs in the collector or view model, which tracks both baselines. Storing a percentage in the domain struct would mean the value is meaningless without knowing the interval over which it was measured — and that interval is not part of the struct. Cumulative milliseconds are the raw truth; any derived value can be computed correctly from them.
